The "**_Unsplash Gallery_**" app is a mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to browse for images from Unsplash.
The app interacts with the Unsplash API to fetch and display high-quality images. This project demonstrates the integration of 
a **RESTful API** within a cross-platform mobile application.
